I am enthusiastic,perceptive and thrive on
challenge and constantly set goals for
myself, so I have something to strive
towards.I am highly organised.I always take
notes, and I use a series of tools to help
myself stay on top of deadlines.I am an
excellent communicator. I pride myself on
making sure people have the right
information because it drives better
results. Most business issues stem from
poor communication, so I feel a
responsibility to keep everyone on the same
page.
